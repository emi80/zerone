\section{Building instructions}

Zerone is available as a Linux command line application and as an R package.

We recommend that you use git to keep Zerone updated. You can clone the
repository from Github with the following command on a standard terminal.

\begin{verbatim}
git clone git@github.com:gui11aume/zerone
\end{verbatim}

Note that this requires that you already have a Github account
and that the computer you are working on has an SSH key registered
on Github. If this is not the case, follow the instructions from
\url{https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/}.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use git, you can download the source code
from \url{https://github.com/gui11aume/zerone/archive/master.zip} with the
following commands.

\begin{verbatim}
wget https://github.com/gui11aume/zerone/archive/master.zip
unzip zerone-master.zip
mv zerone-master zerone
\end{verbatim}

This should create a directory named \texttt{zerone}. To build Zerone,
execute the following.

\begin{verbatim}
cd zerone
make
\end{verbatim}

This should succeed on most Linux systems because \texttt{make} is
available by default. If this is not the case, you can obtain it by
typing \texttt{sudo apt-get install make} on the Ubuntu terminal.

Calling \texttt{make} should create an executable called
\texttt{zerone}. To check that the building is successful, test Zerone with
the following commands.

\begin{verbatim}
cd src/test
make test
cd ../..
\end{verbatim}

If it passes the tests without any error message, then everything went fine
and you are done with the build. If not, then something went
wrong. In this case, you can explain how to reproduce the problem
on \url{https://github.com/gui11aume/zerone/issues}.

\subsection{Installing Rzerone}

To install the Rzerone R package, simply run this command from the
\texttt{zerone} directory.

\begin{verbatim}
R CMD INSTALL Rzerone
\end{verbatim}

Note that you need to have R installed on your computer. If this is not the
case, run the command \texttt{sudo apt-get install r-base} on Ubuntu.

\section{Zerone basics}

To run Zerone, you have to specify the files that contain the mapped reads.
These can be in BED, SAM/BAM, GEM (.map) formats.
type in the following commands from the \texttt{zerone} directory.

\begin{verbatim}
./zerone --mock file1.bam,file2.bam --chip file3.bam,file4.bam
./zerone -l -0 file1.map -1 file2.map -1 file4.map
\end{verbatim}

\section{Troubleshooting}

In case Zerone crashes, start by recompiling it in debug mode. To do so,
run the following commands from the \texttt{zerone} directory.

\begin{verbatim}
make clean
make debug
\end{verbatim}

Then repeat the actions that triggered the crash and contact
\href{mailto:guillaume.filion@gmail.com}{guillaume.filion@gmail.com}
attaching the debug information.

% TODO: Add R crashing part.

\end{document}

% finish with a troubleshooting guide (recompile with make debug and contact me attaching the debug information)
% examples with tiny data sets so that the user can get familiar with the output and the way to call Zerone
% Just explain what the output means (including the output of the SVM)
